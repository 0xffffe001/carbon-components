#Lists

These snippets are primarily intended for implementing lists within the main content area (i.e. non-primary/secondary navigation) *this may change*

## Depth = 1

Use [ordered-lists.html](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/pattern-library/blob/master/lists/ordered-lists.html) and [unordered-lists.html](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/pattern-library/blob/master/lists/unordered-lists.html) components for lists with no sub-lists.

## Depth > 1

Use [nested-list.html](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/pattern-library/blob/master/lists/nested-lists.html) for lists with sub-lists.

OL can be nested in UL, and vice versa.

## Card/Gallery Lists

Use [card-lists.html](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/pattern-library/blob/master/lists/card-lists.html)
