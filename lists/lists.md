#Lists

These snippets are primarily intended for implementing lists within the main content area (i.e. non-primary/secondary navigation) *this may change*

## Depth = 1

Use ordered-lists.html and unordered-lists.html components for lists with no sub-lists.

## Depth > 1

Use nested-list.html for lists with sub-lists.

OL can be nested in UL, and vice versa.

## Card/Gallery Lists

Use card-lists.html
