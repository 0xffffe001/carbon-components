# Links

1. Always prepend classes with `bx` (this is <prepend> in the formulas below)
* Link class options are: `content-link` & `cta-link`.

## Content Link
*Content links most often appear inside of a paragraph.* 


## CTA Link
*CTA links most often appear visually as buttons.*

2. A CTA link recieves its color based on its context (parent).

```
.bx-hero {
	.bx-cta-link {
		// color context
	}
}
```
