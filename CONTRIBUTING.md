Hello!

Bluemix Components is a living resource that adapts and changes over time. It's important that we work together in a transparent and consistent manner.

This documentation is for everyone: contributors and core-team members.

As a core-team member, see [CORE-TEAM.md](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components/blob/master/CORE-TEAM.md) for essential instructions on maintaining this source code repo.

This document is going to walk you through everything you need to know to collaborate on this source code.

## Forking Workflow

![forking-workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/collaborating/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow/01.svg)

We use a **forking workflow** with feature branches for us to collaborate here on GitHub Enterprise (GHE).

For full details on how this works, Atlassian has a [great tutorial article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) we encourage you to read - but while you're here, let's talk about how to get things set up.

## Set up and Sync your Personal Repo
In this section, we are setting up remotes for your fork. These remotes are called `upstream` and `origin`.
* The `origin` remote is set up for you by default. This points to your **personal repo** (or a fork) of bluemix-components. You push your code to this remote.
* The `upstream` remote connects your fork with the official bluemix-components repo. You pull code from this repo.

### Fork and Clone

Go to [bluemix-components](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components) and fork the repo, you'll find a button called 'fork' in the top-right corner.

![fork](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)

When you fork the repo, you're creating a **personal public copy** of the bluemix-components repo. This is known as your **personal repo**. Your personal repo will live under your username.

Next, you need to `git clone` your personal repo to your computer.

```
git clone git@github.ibm.com:YOUR_USERNAME/bluemix-components.git
```

See [GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) for more details.

### Add Upstream Remote

When you clone your personal repo, you will see `origin` is set up for you already by default. This should be pointing to your personal repo.

```
git remote -v

origin  git@github.ibm.com:YOUR_USERNAME/bluemix-components.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.ibm.com:YOUR_USERNAME/bluemix-components.git (push)
```

Now we need to add an `upstream` remote.

In a nutshell, this will enable you to keep your personal repo up to date with the latest changes from the `master` branch of bluemix-components.

```
git remote add upstream git@github.ibm.com:Bluemix/bluemix-components.git
```

Verify the `upstream` remote has been added.

```
git remote -v

origin  git@github.ibm.com:YOUR_USERNAME/bluemix-components.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.ibm.com:YOUR_USERNAME/bluemix-components.git (push)
upstream    git@github.ibm.com:Bluemix/bluemix-components.git (fetch)
upstream    git@github.ibm.com:Bluemix/bluemix-components.git (push)
```

Now that the `upstream` remote is set up, you can update the `master` branch of your personal repo.

This will update your personal repo on your computer and on GHE.

```
# While in your master branch
git pull upstream master
git push origin master
```

If you're responsible for reviewing and maintaining the Bluemix Components repo, please see docs for [Syncing with Other Forks]() in [CORE-TEAM.md](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components/blob/master/CORE-TEAM.md)

(*Pending: See [Issue #219](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components/issues/219)*)

# Contributing to Source Code

Once you've set up your personal repo, and your remotes, you can start making your own contributions to the Bluemix Components repo.

## Issues
Before you work on anything, [find](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components/issues) an issue to work on or [create](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components/issues/new) an issue with a description of what you want to work on (i.e. a bug fix, a new component, refactoring, new docs, etc.)

## Run Bluemix Components
Bluemix Components is equipped to run a static server to enable development of base-elements and components.

In your terminal, make sure to install npm and bower dependencies.

```
npm install & bower install
```

Run the repo for development.

```
npm run dev
```

This is going to run `gulp` from `node_modules`, which handles various front-end tasks that you need for development. Keep this process running in your terminal.

You should see your browser open to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) with [index.html](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components/blob/master/index.html)

This is an html file for you to see what components or base-elements you're working on and how they render in the browser.


## Work in a Branch
Pull down the latest changes from `upstream`.

```
# While in master branch
git pull upstream master
```

Checkout into a new branch for the work you're doing.
Name your branch using slashes.

*(Branch naming convention coming soon)*

```
# component branch
git checkout -b component/cards/refactor-classes

# hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/gulpfile/missing-curly-brace

# feature branch
git checkout -b feature/some-feature/details-about-feature

# task-runner branch
# docs branch
```

Run `gulp build` before committing changes and commit frequently with short messages in present-tense.

```
gulp build
git add <path/to/file>
git commit -m "Add missing semicolon"
```

## Squashing Commits with Rebase

All contributors should squash commits via `git rebase -i` so that there's always **one commit** per **pull request**.

This allows us to:
* better understand our commit history.
* make it easier to revert to a feature.

Let's get started.

Do a `git log` to see your commit history and count the commits you want to squash.

```
# As an example...
git log --oneline

# earliest commit on top, latest commit on bottom...
c46e938 Fix header.js
82d4341 Move docs into new docs folder
22c943b Update README.md
d7fef3e Add missing curly brace
```

Let's say I want to squash the last 4 commits into one commit.

I can do a `git rebase` in `interactive` mode to target the last 4 commits, like this:

```
git rebase -i HEAD~4
```

There's a great excerpt from [this article](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) that explains what's going on really well:

> ...I told Git that I wanted to rebase using the last four commits from where the `HEAD` is with `HEAD~4`. Git has now put me into an editor with the above text in it, and a little explanation of what can be done. You have plenty of options available to you from this screen, but right now weâ€™re just going to squash everything into one commit. So, changing the first four lines of the file to this will do the trick:

```
pick c46e938 Fix header.js
squash 82d4341 Move docs into new docs folder
squash 22c943b Update README.md
squash d7fef3e Add missing curly brace
```
Always `pick` the first commit in this list, `squash` the rest.

This tells Git to combine all four commits into the first commit on this list (the commit with the word `pick` in front).

Git is going to show you one more screen to edit the final commit message, something that looks like this:

```
# This is a combination of 4 commits.
# The first commit's message is:
Fix header.js

# This is the 2nd commit message:

Move docs into new docs folder

# This is the 3rd commit message:

Update README.md

# This is the 4th commit message:

Add missing curly brace

...
```

Edit this message as you want.
You can edit this message so the first commit message is more accurate in describing the overall work these 4 commits is accomplishing.

When you squash your commits for the first time, all your commits are local, which allows you to `git push` normally to your branch:

```
git push origin <branch-name>
```

But after you get feedback on your work, you'll need to `git rebase -i` again and force your pushes:

```
git push origin <branch-name> -f
```


## Pull Requests

Pull requests are how we perform code reviews (the same idea applies to writing docs as well). This is where we do a lot of communication and share constructive criticism, so it's required that everyone **be respectful**.

See our [Code of Conduct](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components/wiki/Code-of-Conduct) for details.

### Create a Pull Request

[This](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request) is a great resource for our approach to pull requests (highly recommended).

After pushing your last commit(s), visit the [Bluemix/bluemix-components](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components/blob/master) and you can find a button that says to 'Create pull request'.

![create-a-pull-request](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-review-create.png)

Sometimes this pull-request button isn't there, so alternatively, you can click on this other pull-request button. It looks like this:

![other-button](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-start-review-button.png)

Clicking this other button will take you to a 'Compare changes' screen. There are two dropdowns to compare two branches. Change the second dropdown to your branch.

*(does this 'compare changes' work across forks?)*

![compare-changes](https://uploads.github.ibm.com/github-enterprise-assets/0000/0076/0000/2327/f635fd24-7c03-11e5-9011-9aff28daaee5.png)

After clicking on 'Create pull request',
you'll be taken to a form where you can enter a title and description.

Write a description for your pull request starting with:
* A reference to the issue that you're resolving (see [closing issues via pull requests](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests))
* Give any extra explanation if needed.


### Collaborate on a Pull Request

Two team members responsible for maintaining Bluemix Components will review your pull request and will:
* Ask questions about your work
* Ask that you make additional changes to your pull request.
* Check to make sure that nothing breaks.

After you get a thumbs up :+1: from two maintainers, you can merge your pull request and delete your branch via the GHE UI.

Once your changes are merged to master, and while you're in the `master` branch, remember to `git pull upstream master` on your fork.

If you're responsible for reviewing and maintaining the Bluemix Components repo, please see docs for [Reviewing Pull Requests]() in [CORE-TEAM.md](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/bluemix-components/blob/master/CORE-TEAM.md).
