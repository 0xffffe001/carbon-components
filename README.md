# Bluemix Pattern Library

**A themeable library of re-usable patterns for building websites and UIs.**

The Bluemix Pattern Library gives developers (FEDs & Engineers) a collection of re-usable patterns they can use for building websites and user-interfaces for Bluemix.

The aim is for every developer to use consistent HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in as many places as possible in their prototype and production work.

## Warning!

This package is in *very* **early stages of development**.

IBMers, please visit our GitHub Enterprise repo (search bluemix pattern-library) to learn how you can contribute.

## Dependencies

By default, this library will reflect the visual design of IBM Bluemix. If you need different colors or typography styles, you will be enabled to do so.

For right now, you will only be able to use Bluemix colors and typography.

Here are the dependencies:

- [bluemix-colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluemix-colors): A palette of Bluemix colors based on [IBM-Design/colors](https://github.com/IBM-Design/colors)
- [bluemix-typography](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluemix-typography): Typography functions, variables and fonts that are commonly used in Bluemix.


## Usable-ish

- buttons
- cards

## Priority To-do List

These are patterns that are in common with sp-styleguide. Define HTML, styles and JavaScript for these patterns first.
