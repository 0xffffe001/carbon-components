# pattern-library
Previously known as Design Guide. More accurately pattern and component collection - for Bluemix, but reusable.

## Commit standards

* Work on feature branches. Do not work and commit to *master*
* Open a pull request when pushing a commit ([hub](https://github.com/github/hub) allows you to do PRs via command line, otherwise you can open them in GHE)
* Where possible, reference a relevant issue that can be updated or closed based on the pull request

*(For a more comprehensive overview of commit standards - [https://github.com/cloud-platform-design/cloud-platform-beta/blob/master/Contributing.md](https://github.com/cloud-platform-design/cloud-platform-beta/blob/master/Contributing.md))*

## Hills

Hills refers to an IBM Design Language practice that allows for teams to achieve alignment on desired outcomes for products.

Please refer to these as guidelines for definining successful development and deployment of the pattern library. Here are the hills.

(See [mural.ly](https://app.mural.ly/t/ibm14/m/ibm14/1432917991069))

### Front-end developer

- **For July 2015**: A front-end developer can markup a page in HTML using only re-usable components.

- A front-end developer can add HTML components to a prototype without any handcrafted code.

- A front-end developer can create a hi-fidelity prototype without needing to code HTML or CSS for any components.

### Engineer

- **For July 2015**: An engineer can use an HTML prototype page to identify implementation pain points when using the pattern library.

- An engineer can receive a hi-fidelity prototype knowing the component code is **always** consistent.

- An engineer can install a package with only the components they need.

### Visual Designer

- A visual designer can provide a mockup and not have to provide any other visual assets.

### The Birthday Cake

This is a milestone hill that is not achievable now but we aim to achieve as a first milestone.

- A front-end developer can build an implementation ready prototype of a single Bluemix page in one hour.

### The Wedding Cake

This is a bigger milestone hill that will be achievable after we've eaten our birthday cake. This is the most desireable product outcome we are building towards.
