# Bluemix Pattern Library

**A themeable library of re-usable patterns for building websites and UIs.**

The Pattern Library gives developers (FEDs & Engineers) a collection of re-usable patterns they can use for building websites and user-interfaces for Bluemix.

The aim is for every developer to use consistent HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in as many places as possible in their prototype and production work.

## Warning!

This package is in *very* **early stages of development**.

IBMers, please visit our GitHub Enterprise repo (search bluemix pattern-library) to learn how you can contribute.

## Priority To-do List
