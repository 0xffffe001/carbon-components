Previously known as Design Guide. More accurately pattern and component collection - for Bluemix, but reusable.

## Commit standards

* Work on feature branches. Do not work and commit to *master*
* Open a pull request when pushing a commit ([hub](https://github.com/github/hub) allows you to do PRs via command line, otherwise you can open them in GHE)
* Where possible, reference a relevant issue that can be updated or closed based on the pull request
